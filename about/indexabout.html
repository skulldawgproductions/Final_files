        >About Skully:<br />SDP started out as a crazy idea involving a
        high-school student, a glut of art supplies, too many feels, and an
        obsession with Adobe. Our intrepid adventurer, through many trials,
        failures and long, sleepless nights at a drawing board has finally come
        to his plateau, providing the gift of art to all who seek it!<br /><br />Welcome
        to Skulldawg Productions, Where the Dawg Makes His Bones...<br
